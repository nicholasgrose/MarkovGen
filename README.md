# MarkovGen

This is a redo of a previous attempt at basic procedural generation backed by Markov Chains. Currently, the best implementation in this repo uses the Ising Model.

## Note

The implementation of Markov Chain used here is entirely custom, but it is meant to be able to be used for any set implemenation of markov chains.
